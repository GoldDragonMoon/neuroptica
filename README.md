# neuroptica [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/neuroptica/badge/?version=latest)](https://neuroptica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fancompute/neuroptica.svg?token=CSoUuvqmixfJpdwkLqet&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fancompute/neuroptica)

`neuroptica` is a flexible chip-level simulation platform for nanophotonic neural networks written in Python/NumPy. It provides a wide range of abstracton levels for simulating optical NN's: the lowest-level functionality allows you to manipulate the arrangement and properties of individual phase shifters on a simulated chip, and the highest-level features provide a Keras-like API for designing optical NN by stacking network layers.
